## General Information

- Ledit is a online code editor web app developed for develop many websites and web apps via this. We can code and edit web markup languages here. It makes the web development ease, beacause from now we don't need to worry about our device and it's capacity for try web development.
- Ledit will run on any device which have an internet and a web browser like Chrome.
- Why this project?The answer was in my early days my learning time was very weird beacause i don't have any laptops at the time. So I learned web development in my smartphone. We can learn through smartphone easily, but practising is little bit tough in smartphone. And at that I'm also not aware of online code editors so i practised only on the computer in my school laboratory.
- I developed this project for the remembering my early days. Hope you liked this story ;)
